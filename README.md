# ReShade-Shaders-REPO-update-scripts
Very simple shell scripts to keep ReShade Shaders up-to-date.

# To use
- First make sure you have Git installed https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Run these scripts from the directory you want to store the repos in.
     - **1-Fresh-Clone-Shader-Repos.sh** will delete and clone the repos from scratch.
	 - **2-Update-Shader-Repos.sh** will pull updates only.

# More info
I will update the scripts as I find more established shader repos.
